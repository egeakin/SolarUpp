## What is SolarUpp
SolarUpp aims to have a feasibility study on solar energy production and efficiency on building rooftops in order to increase usage of green energy. In this web application, solar ratings of rooftops will be calculated by gathered information from images of rooftops. The users will easily find their building’s images by entering their addresses. After finding their buildings, users will be able to choose spaces to plant solar panels on their rooftops. In order to calculate solar energy production, users will have the chance to compare different solar panels and inverters to find optimum solution on their rooftops in terms of cost, size and efficiency.

Beside a feasibility study on energy production, SolarUpp will also provide 3D model of rooftop by visualization to show user’s rooftops final state after plantation of solar panels and inverters by regarding real size of solar components and chosen free space on rooftops. To calculate solar energy production in best way SolarUpp will be able to determine distinct obstacles on rooftops such as pools and air conditioning components to calculate free space on roofs .

After solar panel plantation, generated solar energy amount will be gathered from registered users’s inverters in time intervals like one week. Gathered information will be uploaded to our system to compare expected and generated value of solar energy. Recent weather conditions in the area of specified building will be checked to see if there are any additional reasons which cause low energy production than expected rather than unexpected weather conditions. For example, if a rooftop have great difference between expected and produced energy level in optimum weather conditions, registered users will be informed with a warning message about the need of maintenance check or an unexpected problem. 

SolarUpp is a green field project which aims to increase solar energy usage by gathering information from rooftop’s images which are taken from above. Using images of rooftops to have a feasibility study is an essential point for large scale using by users.
